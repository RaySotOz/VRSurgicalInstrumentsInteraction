<h1>VR Surgical Instruments Interaction</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project I wanted to enhance my experience i
on the VR experiences. I used Google Cardboard because it allow me to being able to develop VR projects in Unity without the expensive hardware. 
Of course there are advantages and disadvantages of doing this, but being able to control my development with my cellphone give me the opportunity to work fast. For this project, I used a VR hand model and make them follow the camera view. Then, with the aid of VFX it was possible to interact with the virtual environment. Using the free assests in the Unity Store, I was able to get some surgical instruments. I placed these objects on the virtual environment and developed the programming and animations to make possible to the user grabbing these objects, move around the virtual world with the objects attached, and leave them in their original position.
