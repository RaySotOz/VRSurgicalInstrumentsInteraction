<h1>VR Surgical Instruments Interaction</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project I wanted to enhance my experience in the VR experiences. I used Google Cardboard because it allow me to being able to develop VR projects in Unity without the expensive hardware. 
Of course there are advantages and disadvantages of doing this, but being able to control my development with my cellphone give me the opportunity to work fast. For this project, I used a VR hand models and make them follow the camera view. Then, with the aid of VFX it was possible to interact with the virtual environment. Using the free assest in the Unity Store, I was able to get some surgical instruments. I placed this object in the virtual environment and make the programming and animations to make possible to the user to grab this objects, move around the virtual world with the objects attach, and leave them in their original position.
